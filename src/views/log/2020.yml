    My key takeaways are:
      - _Don't start with a joke._
      - _Build fence around your ideas._
      - _Talk in cycles._
      - _Provide verbal punctuations, so lost can join back._
      - _Ask a question._
      - _Every presentation has too many slides and too many words._
      - _Hapax Legomenon complex silde._
      - _Don't thank._
      - _Maybe end with a joke._
      - _Your ideas are like your children, you don't want them going to rags._
