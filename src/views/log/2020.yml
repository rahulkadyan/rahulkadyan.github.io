    It's a chilling short story that keeps you thinking and wanting more. I like how the book starts: !["I didn't stop giving hand jobs because I wasn't good at it. I stopped giving hand jobs because I was the best at it."](/assets/the-grownup.jpg)

    ## **Highlights**

    - Feeling sad means having too much time on your hands, usually.

    ## Notes

    Imitation can be a powerful tool to be liked and find who likes you.
    Repetation can convert non-believers into believers.
    Subliminal message can make people do things.
    Family photos in workplace make people work harder.

    ## Highlights

    - We need to be able to see ourselves not as we really are but as other people perceive us to be.
    - Imitation is a ubiquitous social lubricant.
    - Trust is one of the magical, irrational ingredients that makes human relationships work.
    - Remembering something doesn't mean it happened.
    - Disgust gives us a strong aversion to things, but it also has to be malleable. Strongly smelling cheeses are unpleasant on first acquaintance, but this revulsion can be overcome.
    - The teachings of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism can't all be true. But even the wrong ones have millions of believers.  
      ...  
      They must be using some powerful technique.
    - Ultimately, we are biological computers designed by evolution, built through genetics, and programmed by the environment.
    - The most effective adverts can be those we don't notice, carried by people who don't know they're advertising.
    - Nobody ever had sex, found shelter, or caught dinner just by thinking about it.
    - The unconscious brain makes decisions. The conscious brain invents reasons for those decisions.
    - Most of us do use stereotypes to make judgments, even when we belong to the stereotyped groups.
    - We feel our pain in the way that others see our pain.
    - If we're not in control of our thoughts, must somebody else be?
    - Our ancestors had gods of the wind, the seasons, the sea. And when we can't control our own minds, we're happy to invent another one that can control it.
    - The hardest and most important thing humans can do isn't mathematics, philosophy, engineering, or even science. It's dealing with other people. We're more complicated than algebra, deeper than metaphysics, and less predictable than earthquakes.
    - The fact we can and do talk about what we consciously experience opens it up to natural selection, and this selection is social: it is other people's decision to date us or punch us after hearing what we say, which determines whether we contribute genes to the next generation.
    - If you believe you will win, it's more likely to happen.
    - Once consciousness has learned that you're likely to fail, it stops sending signals to the brain to do the social preferred thing and instead uses its resources to explain why you've failed.
    - If Michael Jordan had the mantra, "Basketball's really hard, but I'm going to give it my best shot," he might not have gained the nickname 'Air Jordan.'
    - "Show, don't tell."
    - Free will is something we experience rather that have or don't have.
    - Knowing that you are trapped in an illusion doesn't help you to escape.

    I found it as good as the first season. It is informative, conflictive, quirky, excellently conveys so many perfectives and throughout enjoyable.

    My key takeaways are:
      - _Don't start with a joke._
      - _Build fence around your ideas._
      - _Talk in cycles._
      - _Provide verbal punctuations, so lost can join back._
      - _Ask a question._
      - _Every presentation has too many slides and too many words._
      - _Hapax Legomenon complex silde._
      - _Don't thank._
      - _Maybe end with a joke._
      - _Your ideas are like your children, you don't want them going to rags._
