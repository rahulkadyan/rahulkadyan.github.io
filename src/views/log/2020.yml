    My key takeaways are:
      - _Don't start with a joke._
      - _Build fence around your ideas._
      - _Talk in cycles._
      - _Provide verbal punctuations, so lost can join back._
      - _Ask a question._
      - _Every presentation has too many slides and too many words._
      - _Hapax Legomenon complex silde._
      - _Don't thank._
      - _Maybe end with a joke._
      - _Your ideas are like your children, you don't want them going to rags._

    - Trust is one of the magical, irrational ingredients that makes human relationships work.
    - Remembering something doesn't mean it happened.
    - Disgust gives us a strong aversion to things, but it also has to be malleable. Strongly smelling cheeses are unpleasant on first acquaintance, but this revulsion can be overcome.
    - The teachings of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism can't all be true. But even the wrong ones have millions of believers.  
      ...  
      They must be using some powerful technique.
    - Ultimately, we are biological computers designed by evolution, built through genetics, and programmed by the environment.

    I found it as good as the first season. It is informative, conflictive, quirky, excellently conveys so many perfectives and throughout enjoyable.
