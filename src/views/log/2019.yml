    ## **Highlights**

    - We need to be able to see ourselves not as we really are but as other people perceive us to be.
    - Imitation is a ubiquitous social lubricant.
    - Trust is one of the magical, irrational ingredients that makes human relationships work.
    - Remembering something doesn't mean it happened.
    - Disgust gives us a strong aversion to things, but it also has to be malleable. Strongly smelling cheeses are unpleasant on first acquaintance, but this revulsion can be overcome.
    - The teachings of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism can't all be true. But even the wrong ones have millions of believers.  
      ...  
      They must be using some powerful technique.
    - Ultimately, we are biological computers designed by evolution, built through genetics, and programmed by the environment.

    This is my first enconter with the witcher universe (I tried to play the game
    too but it was too overwhelming for me), I absolutely loved it. I am planning
    to read the books next.

    I love how the movie is accurately titled "Marley & Me" as every character
    in the movie had their own dynamic with Marley. And my dog, Dash, is very
    simmilar to Marley.

    The author paints a picture of a different world and to be honest I don't feel something farfetched, I can draw parallels to today's world.    

    ## **Highlights**

    - I like this book "Free Thought Writing Style" if that's a thing, the text takes you in character's head and you hear things as she thinks, no filters here, it's a stream of pure raw thoughts.

        > NIGHT FALLS. OR has fallen. Why is it that night falls, instead of rising, like the dawn? Yet if you look east, at sunset, you can see night rising, not falling; darkness lifting into the sky, up from the horizon, like a black sun behind cloud cover. Like smoke from an unseen fire, a line of fire just below the horizon, brushfire or a burning city. Maybe night falls because it’s heavy, a thick curtain pulled up over the eyes. Wool blanket. I wish I could see in the dark, better than I do. Night has fallen, then.

    - She is always thinking and often gets flashes from past which are so vivid, but farfetched and seemingly impossible from her present stand. The writing creates an engaging world and keeps the reader thinking where in time she is, then writer drops subtle hints just enough to jolt readers back in time, often left with awe.

    My takeaways from the book:

    * _Do it everyday. Do it as a debt of honour. And make a commitment to finishing things._
    * _I'm lost too. But I know._
    * _Hope begins in dark. You show up and try to do the right thing and dawn will come._
    * _**You tell your version and I am going to tell mine.**_
    * _Writing is like driving at night, you can see as far as headlights but you can make the trip. You don't have to see the destination, or everything that pass along. You have to see two or three metres ahead of you._
    * _Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor._
