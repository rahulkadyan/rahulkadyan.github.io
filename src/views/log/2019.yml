    My takeaways from the book:

    * _Do it everyday. Do it as a debt of honour. And make a commitment to finishing things._
    * _I'm lost too. But I know._
    * _Hope begins in dark. You show up and try to do the right thing and dawn will come._
    * _**You tell your version and I am going to tell mine.**_
    * _Writing is like driving at night, you can see as far as headlights but you can make the trip. You don't have to see the destination, or everything that pass along. You have to see two or three metres ahead of you._
    * _Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor._
