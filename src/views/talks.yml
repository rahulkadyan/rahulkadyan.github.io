- title: Building for Developer Experience
  description: |-
      At Myntra, we have hundreds of micro applications built over a few years by a continuously changing team. Different people brought different ideas, and these applications became an amalgam of different design processes, themes, libraries, and tools with lack of any governing principles. These differences and no governance led to multiple forks in design and experience. Now, we have a solution which unifies the forks, makes it easier to deliver consistent user experience and much more.
      
      In this talk, I share the problems we faced: 
      - In maintaining a component library.
      - In supporting hundreds of applications.
      - In communicating design decisions.

      And how we ended up building tools for fixing broken developer experience, which in turn addressed the issues of user experience inconsistencies.

      In short, this is a story of re-making of a design system until it made sense to everyone.

- title: 'Demystifying: The Dark Art of SFC Compilation'
  description: >+
    Vue single file components empowers developers with the ability to write declarative 
    render functions using plain HTML-like syntax. The so-called SFCs also provide features 
    like collocation and scoped styles. We tend to use these SFCs effortlessly as any other 
    JavaScript file but to reach that level of ease, Vue does the heavy lifting of 
    transpilation. This talk takes a deep dive in the compilation process of Vue components 
    and explains how to write a custom block processor. It also discovers some less known 
    facts about SFCs.
