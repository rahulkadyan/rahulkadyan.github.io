- title: 'Demystifying: The Dark Art of SFC Compilation'
  description: >+
    Vue single file components empowers developers with the ability to write declarative 
    render functions using plain HTML-like syntax. The so-called SFCs also provide features 
    like collocation and scoped styles. We tend to use these SFCs effortlessly as any other 
    JavaScript file but to reach that level of ease, Vue does the heavy lifting of 
    transpilation. This talk takes a deep dive in the compilation process of Vue components 
    and explains how to write a custom block processor. It also discovers some less known 
    facts about SFCs.
